Simple PowerShell script to quickly add Windows Firewall Rules. I quickly grew tired of adding firewall rules through the GUI and figured this could be automated in some way. Feel free to make any edits you see fit, any and all suggestions are appreciated! 

This script must be run from an Administrator prompt otherwise you will not have sufficient permissions to implement rules.
